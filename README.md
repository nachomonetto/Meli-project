# Meli-project
This is a project that was created using Airflow and Pandas and aims to perfom a typical ETL process where the source is the Mercado Libre API. The main goal here is extracting the daily snapshot of the 50 most relevant products of a certain category and loading the data into a Postgres DB. There's only one .py file that aims to be a DAG factory that creates one DAG per category to be extracted. The DAG factory reads different json files (one per category) that contains info about the categories like the API endpoint, the name of the category and the fields to take into account for the ingestion.
